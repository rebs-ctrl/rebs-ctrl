TO DO LIST:

1. Half 2D board (fake 3D grid board) -> continuous movement 
                                      -> coordination based interactive range of the object
                                      -> use collisions box (use placeholders before design team gives us the board)
2. Game manager -> level, timer, money count, ingredients available, order requests 
3. Player controler -> directional button, keyboard
4. More interactions with objects (eg. tables)  -> lvl 2
5. Object class (eg. dish class -> actions related to dishes) 

6. Add functionality to the map (add clickable button to each scene)
7. Handle the trivia pop-up (make it clickable for answer)

EXTRA: power-ups -> additional button for speed vs. manually increase speed 

FIRST STEP FOR PROGRAMMERS: player movement, blockage will stop the player
